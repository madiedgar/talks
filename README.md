# Better Together: Leveraging the Alumni Community
Workshop (45 minutes) for all audiences

## Abstract 
The love one has for hackathons, stays well after graduation. As an organizer/student leader, learn why you need alumni, how to strategically recruit, and how to best utilize their strengths and resources when they’re on board. 

## Description
Alumni are one of the best, untapped resources to take your hackathon to the next level. 
Discover ways to add exponential value by strategically selecting the right alumni for your specific event. Learn where you can utilize their strengths and resources to foster a stronger community and build great relationships along the way.

## Notes
I **love** the hacker community, and just because I graduated doesn’t mean that love has changed. However, the ways in which I can bring value to a hackathon _has_. After graduation, I became heavily involved with Florida Hackers. I was fortunate enough not only to attend numerous hackathons, but to lead workshops, mentor hackers, help organize, judge demos and even hack a little. I realized the amount of influence and value an alumna can bring, and would love the opportunity to teach others.
